        <ul>After the Second World War there was a high flow of immigration to the Netherlands, 
            which largely consisted of immigrants from the former colony of the Dutch East Indies. 
            On August 17, 1945, the proclamation of the Republic of Indonesia was by first president Sukarno. 
            In 1946 there is a significant increase in migrants from Indonesia. In 1949 Queen Juliana signs 
            the transfer of sovereignty to the United States of Indonesia. In 1950 the Royal Dutch-Indonesian
            Army (KNIL) was abolished and the Netherlands brought the former soldiers and their families to 
            the Netherlands because of political tensions and promised the immigrants a short stay in the Netherlands.
            Nevertheless, they will never return and this is the beginning of the Moluccan community in the Netherlands,
            the old military immigrants and their descendants strive for an independent Republic in the South Moluccas.
