                <h3>The Data</h3>
                <p>This Graphic depicts the population growth of the Netherlands in relation 
                    to the immigration flow of Indonesians in a time period in which both countries
                    have significant ties with eachoter. After the Second World War there was a high flow of 
                    immigration to the Netherlands, which largely consisted of immigrants from the former colony
                    of the Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia. To read the visualization one should
                    understand the history behind the data which will help the reader follow significant
                    events depicted in the visualization. Read the explanation and see the events
                    depicted per year in the data visuals.

                <h3>it's History</h3>
                <p> 
                    On August 17, 1945, the proclamation of the Republic of Indonesia was by first president Sukarno. 
                    In 1946 there is a significant increase in migrants from Indonesia. In 1949 Queen Juliana signs 
                    the transfer of sovereignty to the United States of Indonesia.In 1950 the Royal Dutch-Indonesian
                    Army (KNIL) was abolished and the Netherlands brought the former soldiers and their families to 
                    the Netherlands because of political tensions and promised the immigrants a short stay in the Netherlands.
                    Most migrants strive for an independent Republic in the South Moluccas for their own, independent from Indonesia.
                    They identify themselves with 'Moluccan' instead of Indonesian.The last boat containing old militants sails in 1953. The migrants will never be returned, which is 
                    the beginning of the Moluccan community in the Netherlands. Some immigrants still live in special communties
                    and have up to 5 generations descendants.
